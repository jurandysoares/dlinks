## Quotes

> " The past is whatever the records and the 
> memories agree upon. And since the party is
> in full control of all records and in equally
> full control of the minds of its members, it
> follows that the past is whatever the party chooses to make it."
> (George Orwell, 1984)

> "What matters in life is not what happens to you, but what you remember and how you remember it."
> (Gabriel Garcias Marques, One hundred years of solitude)

> "It might be true that the average human being
> was better off now than they had been before
> the revolution. The only evidence to the
> contrary was the mute protest in your own
> bones. The instinctive feeling that the conditions
> you lived in were intolerable and that at some
> other time they have been different."
> (George Orwell, 1984)

On fear of death and the totalitarism:

> "For how could the fear, the hatred, and the
> lunatic credulity which the party needed in its
> members be kept at the right pitch. Except by
> bottling downn some powerfull instinct and
> using it as a driving force?"

> "The mind should develop a blind spot whenever
> a dangerous thought presented itself.
> The process should be automatic, instinctive.
> Crimestop, they called it in newspeak."

> "...no way of knowing whether you were being
> watched at any given moment."
